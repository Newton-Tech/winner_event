a smart contract named "Contract". It has an event called "Winner" that takes an argument of type "address". The contract also has an external function named "attempt" that calls the "Winner" event.

In the "attempt" function, the code first uses the require() statement to check if the msg.sender is not equal to tx.origin. msg.sender is the address of the caller of the function and tx.origin is the address that originated the transaction. If msg.sender is equal to tx.origin, the function will throw an error with the message "msg.sender is equal to tx.origin".

If msg.sender is not equal to tx.origin, the function will call the "Winner" event with the emit statement and pass msg.sender as the argument. This will trigger the event and log the winner's address.

Please note that the contract is using an old version of the Solidity compiler (0.8.0) and it is recommended to use a more recent version for better security and features.
